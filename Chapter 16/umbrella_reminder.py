# ATBS - Chapter 16 - Umbrella Reminder
#
# Chapter 11 showed you how to use the requests module to scrape data from
# http://weather.gov/. Write a program that runs just before you wake up in the
# morning and checks whether itâ€™s raining that day. If so, have the program text
# you a reminder to pack an umbrella before leaving the house.
#
# This project cannot be completed, as the way Twilio works has changed, and
# the TwilioRestClient method described in the chapter is now deprecated and
# no longer works. I imagine this is probably updated in ATBS 2nd Edition.
