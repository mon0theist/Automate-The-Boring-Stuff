# ATBS - Chatper 18 - Game-Playing Bot Tutorial
#
# There is a great tutorial titled “How to Build a Python Bot That Can Play Web
# Games” that you can find at http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/. This tutorial
# explains how to create a GUI automation program in Python that plays a Flash
# game called Sushi Go Round. The game involves clicking the correct ingredient
# buttons to fill customers’ sushi orders. The faster you fill orders without
# mistakes, the more points you get. This is a perfectly suited task for a GUI
# automation program—and a way to cheat to a high score! The tutorial covers many
# of the same topics that this chapter covers but also includes descriptions of
# PyAutoGUI’s basic image recognition features.
