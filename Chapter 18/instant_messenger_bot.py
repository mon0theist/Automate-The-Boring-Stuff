# ATBS - Chapter 18 - Instant Messenger Bot
#
# Google Talk, Skype, Yahoo Messenger, AIM, and other instant messaging
# applications often use proprietary protocols that make it difficult for others
# to write Python modules that can interact with these programs. But even these
# proprietary protocols can’t stop you from writing a GUI automation tool.
#
# The Google Talk application has a search bar that lets you enter a username on
# your friend list and open a messaging window when you press ENTER. The keyboard
# focus automatically moves to the new window. Other instant messenger applications
# have similar ways to open new message windows. Write a program that will
# automatically send out a notification message to a select group of people on
# your friend list. Your program may have to deal with exceptional cases, such as
# friends being offline, the chat window appearing at different coordinates on
# the screen, or confirmation boxes that interrupt your messaging. Your program
# will have to take screen-shots to guide its GUI interaction and adopt ways of
# detecting when its virtual keystrokes aren’t being sent.
#
# Note
# You may want to set up some fake test accounts so that you don’t accidentally
# spam your real friends while writing this program.
#
# Google Talk is dead, using Google Hangouts instead
