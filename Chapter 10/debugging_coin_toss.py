# The following program is meant to be a simple coin toss guessing game. The
# player gets two guesses (itâ€™s an easy game). However, the program has several
# bugs in it. Run through the program a few times to find the bugs that keep the
# program from working correctly.

# I didn't really use the debugging tools, just ran the program a couple times
# and then started looking at the code and fixing it

# import needed modules
import random, logging, traceback

# set logging level (copied from Chapter 10 example_)

# disables logging, comment out the following line to re-enable debugging
