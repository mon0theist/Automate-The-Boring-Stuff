# Automate-The-Boring-Stuff
My solutions to Al Sweigart's "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python" book. There are multiple attempts for some of the early problem sets, as I've tried to complete this book several different times, and I also wanted to ensure I remembered how to complete the problems more than once for comprehension.

All solutions are done using only what's been taught in the book up to that point. Other solutions on GitHub use techniques that weren't taught in the book, which completely defeats the point in my opinion.
