# ATBS - Chapter 13 - PDF Paranoia (Part 2)
#
# Using the os.walk() function from Chapter 9, write a script that will go through
# every PDF in a folder (and its subfolders) and encrypt the PDFs using a password
# provided on the command line. Save each encrypted PDF with an _encrypted.pdf
# suffix added to the original filename. Before deleting the original file, have
# the program attempt to read and decrypt the file to ensure that it was encrypted
# correctly.
#
# Then, write a program that finds all encrypted PDFs in a folder (and its subfolders)
# and creates a decrypted copy of the PDF using a provided password. If the password
# is incorrect, the program should print a message to the user and continue to
# the next PDF
